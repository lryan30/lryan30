Hi there 👋

I’m currently completing a Higher Diploma in Computing in Data Analytics at ATU Galway (2024–2026).

I come from a strong scientific and healthcare background and enjoy working with data, code, and technology to solve practical problems.

- I work mainly with Python and SQL for data analysis
- I enjoy building well designed, well structured projects
- I’m interested in applying analytics to real-world and healthcare-related problems
- I have a strong interest in continuous learning and applied problem-solving
